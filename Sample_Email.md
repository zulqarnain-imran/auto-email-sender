Dear HR Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am **Hafiz Muhammad Mateen**, a recent Computer Science graduate from **UET Lahore (May 2025)** with a **CGPA of 4.0/4.0**, and I’m reaching out to express my keen interest in a relevant software or AI/ML engineering role at your esteemed organization.

In my **FYP**, I developed an advanced deep learning-based **Retinal Disease Detection System** using fundus images, incorporating segmentation with models like ***Attention-UNet*** and ***DeepLabV3+***. The project aims to assist ophthalmologists in early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy ... a real-world healthcare problem.

**Some of my other Projects:**
• **Real-Time Object Detection (YOLOv5)**
• **Urdu NLP Sentiment Analyzer & Summarizer**
• **Alumni Management System (.NET)**
• **IT Support Ticketing Platform (MERN Stack)**

With strong foundations in *AI/ML/DL, Python, MERN Stack, and WordPress*, I’m passionate about solving meaningful problems and learning in collaborative environments.

📎 My resume is attached for your review. I’d greatly appreciate any opportunity to contribute to your team.

Warm Regards,
**Hafiz Muhammad Mateen**
